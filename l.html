        <h1>LOVE LETTER❤️</h1>
        <p class="date">Feb 15, 2025</p>
        <p>It has been 11 months since we started this beautiful journey of our life. I cherish every moment that I spend with you, my love. Half of these months were tough for us because we were over-attached, and missing each other was a heavy burden. It wouldn't have lasted this long if you weren't strong and patient, my dear Leuel. 😘😘😘 I love you so much. 😘😘😘 My world, I am so grateful for having you in my life. I always say that, but now I realize my mental health wouldn't be the same without you, my love, my therapist, my best friend. Even if you hide your feelings from me, life would have been hard without you. But God gave me a good listener and a supportive husband. 😘😘😘😘 I love you so much, my world. Beyond this, I hope for many years and months ahead, leading to a happy ending for our love. I am thankful that our love will serve as an example for everyone beyond this, and that we will experience beautiful moments that we will never forget. For our children, I hope we will be a successful life model. Happy 11-month anniversary, my love. 😘😘😘😘 I love you so much. I wish I could say more. 😘😘😘 I will love you always and forever. ❤️ Even after death, I will never find one like you. 😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ I LOVE YOU. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️</p>
        <p class="signature">Forever yours❤️</p>
